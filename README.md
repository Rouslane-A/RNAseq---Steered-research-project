# RNAseq---Steered-research-project
## Overview
### Objective
The objective of this repository is to conduct a comprehensive reanalysis of the paper titled 'Single-cell Analysis Reveals Inter- and Intratumour Heterogeneity in Metastatic Breast Cancer' while also performing a novel single-cell analysis using alternative computational methods. The primary goal is to replicate the experimental analyses described in the original paper to assess the reprudicility of the findings. Additionally, this project aims to compare the results obtained from the replication with those derived from the alternative pipelines and software, thereby identifying any additional insights. The repository provides code, data, and documentation to facilitate replication, comparison and interpretation of the analyses conducted.

### Replication of Original Analysis
The reanalysis of the original paper involves replicating the experimental procedures and computational analyses described in the paper. The code provided in this repository aims to reproduce the results presented in the original publication.
### Novel Analysis
In addition to replicating the original analysis, this project includes a novel single-cell analysis using alternative pipelines and software. the goal of this analysis is to compare the results obtained from different computational approaches and identify any additional insights that may arise from using alternative methodologies.
